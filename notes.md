# Notes

- `Outlet` is synonimous with `children` in React
- `dynamic` routes are made with `$` in the file name

## Supabase

- auto generated api docs are super cool
- Able to only fetch the fields we want, stops over fetching like gql

## Remix

- env vars can be passed frm server to browser by using a loader. Seeing the loader in the root file and the supabase.ts for an example
